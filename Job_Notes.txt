Hi,

In reading your Fiverr page it seems you may be capable of writing a sketch
for which I'm hiring. This sketch is a very basic, simple web interface
that saves user inputs to a .txt file. The webpape should be very simple as it only
provides an example that will be improved later. This project uses an ESP8266 or ESP32
and an SD micro read/write module such as seen here:

https://goo.gl/GSTv2w

The user input is stored to the SD card in a highly specific format. The following is
an example of how it should work. Please review this with the provided picture
for a better understanding.

Option 1 will output to sd card txt file (named bingo.txt):
"Selected 1"
Option 2 will output to sd card txt file (named bingo.txt):
"Selected 2"
Option 3 will output to sd card txt file (named bingo.txt):
"Selected 3"
Option 4 will output to sd card txt file (named bingo.txt):
"Selected 4"
Option 5 will output to sd card txt file (named bingo.txt):
"Selected 5"
Text Field will output whatever the user writes into that field. For example,
if the user types:
"There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
randomised words which don't look even slightly believable."
in the .txt file should be saved as

<text field>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</text field>

Each time the test.txt file is written it should save and overwrite the existing test.txt file that has
and save the new entries.

For the examples shown above, the final text file should format like this:

<option1>Selected 1</option1>
<option2>Selected 2</option2>
<option3>Selected 3</option3>
<option4>Selected 4</option4>
<option5>Selected 5</option5>
<text field>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</text field>

However, if the user does not select an option or the text field, it should not
be saved to the .txt file. So, if the user selected 1, 3, and 5, the .txt would be
like this:

<option1>Selected 1</option1>
<option3>Selected 3</option3>
<option5>Selected 5</option5>

When the user presses the "Submit" button on the page it should then overwrite the
existing test.txt and save the entries as a new test.txt.

In the code please include all necessary notation for libraries used, pin assignments,
etc. and include the necessary configuration for using Wifi Manager.

If you are interested, please respond with the amount of time this job would require and
what day you can begin.

Thank you kindly,
Alan Minor

Please comment the code to simplify this for updates later. The final sketch
will use different options with this serving as a start point to learn from.
